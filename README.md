# Color In Landscapes
With 100+ paintings about landscapes in Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) collection, I explored the main color used in each painting to find the pattern of color use in landscape paintings.


## API
### Data Source
Request data from [the MET Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/).

### Color Calculation
Analyzed the main color of each downloaded image with [Color Thief](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/).
